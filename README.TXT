**Project Name**: Simple Web-Based Calculator

**Description**:  
This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation. The user interface is designed with a visually appealing background and interactive buttons.

### Project Structure:

1. **HTML (index.html)**:
    - Contains the structure of the calculator, including input fields and buttons.
    - Uses Bootstrap for responsive design and styling.

2. **CSS (style.css)**:
    - Provides custom styling for the calculator, including fonts, colors, and shadows.
    - The calculator interface is designed with a neon-like glowing effect for the buttons and the display.
    - A background image enhances the visual appeal of the calculator.

3. **JavaScript (javascrip.js)**:
    - Handles the core functionality of the calculator, including operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and clearing the display.
    - `eval()` is used for performing the calculations, with safeguards against empty or invalid input.
    - The `AC` button clears the display, while `DEL` deletes the last entered character.

### Features:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation.
- **AC (All Clear)**: Clears the entire input.
- **DEL (Delete)**: Deletes the last input character.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   Navigate to the directory where the project is saved and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. **Ensure Internet Connectivity**:
   The project uses external CSS and JavaScript libraries (Bootstrap and jQuery) from CDNs. Make sure you have an internet connection to load these resources.

### Files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the calculator interface.
- **style.css**: Custom styles for the calculator.
- **javascrip.js**: Handles button click events and calculator logic.

### External Resources:
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and layout. (CDN link included in HTML)
- **jQuery**: For button event handling. (CDN link included in HTML)

### How to Use:
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Use the buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations.
3. The `AC` button clears all input, and `DEL` removes the last digit or operator.
